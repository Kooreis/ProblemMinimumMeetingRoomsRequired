# Question: How do you find the minimum number of meeting rooms required given meeting time intervals? C# Summary

The C# program is designed to determine the minimum number of meeting rooms required given a list of meeting time intervals. The program first defines a `Meeting` class with `Start` and `End` properties to represent the start and end times of a meeting. The `MinMeetingRooms` function is then defined to calculate the minimum number of meeting rooms needed. This function sorts the start and end times of the meetings and iterates through them, keeping track of the number of rooms currently in use. If a meeting starts after another one ends, the same room can be used, decreasing the count of used rooms. If a meeting starts before another one ends, a new room is needed, increasing the count of used rooms. The function ultimately returns the maximum number of rooms in use at any point, which represents the minimum number of rooms required. The `Main` function creates a list of meetings and outputs the result of the `MinMeetingRooms` function.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution uses a similar approach to the C# version, but with some differences due to the language features and standard libraries available in Python.

1. Data Structure: In the C# version, a class `Meeting` is defined to hold the start and end times of a meeting. In Python, a simple tuple is used to hold the start and end times. This is because Python supports packing multiple values into a single variable using tuples.

2. Sorting: Both versions sort the meetings based on start times. In C#, the `OrderBy` method is used on a list of `Meeting` objects, while in Python, the `sort` method is used on a list of tuples. The Python version uses a lambda function as the key for sorting, which is a feature not available in C#.

3. Priority Queue: The Python version uses a priority queue (implemented with a heap) to keep track of the end times of the meetings. This is done using the `heapq` module in Python, which provides an implementation of heaps based on lists. The C# version does not use a priority queue, but instead uses two separate arrays for start times and end times, and two pointers to keep track of the current position in each array.

4. User Input: The Python version asks the user for input, while the C# version has the meeting times hardcoded. This is not a difference in language features, but a difference in how the problem is presented to the user.

5. Function Definitions: In Python, functions are defined using the `def` keyword, while in C#, functions are defined as methods inside a class. The Python version also uses the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct to ensure that the `main` function is only run when the script is executed directly, and not when it is imported as a module.

6. Return Values: Both versions return the minimum number of meeting rooms required. In Python, this is done by returning the length of the heap, while in C#, this is done by returning the `minRooms` variable.

# Java Differences

The Java version of the solution uses a different approach to solve the problem. Instead of sorting the start and end times separately, it sorts the intervals array based on the start times of the meetings. It then uses a priority queue to keep track of the end times of the meetings. The priority queue is a data structure that always keeps the smallest element at the front, which is useful in this case because it allows us to easily check if a meeting can be scheduled in a room that has become free.

The `minMeetingRooms` function works by first adding the end time of the first meeting to the priority queue. It then iterates over the rest of the intervals. For each interval, it checks if the start time of the meeting is greater than or equal to the end time of the meeting that ends earliest (which is the front of the priority queue). If it is, it means that the current meeting can be scheduled in the room that has become free, so it removes the end time from the priority queue. Whether or not a room has become free, it adds the end time of the current meeting to the priority queue. Finally, it returns the size of the priority queue, which is the number of rooms in use.

The main differences between the Java and C# versions are the use of a priority queue in Java and the use of LINQ and arrays in C#. The Java version also uses a 2D array to represent the intervals, while the C# version uses a list of `Meeting` objects. The Java version uses a lambda expression to define the comparator for the priority queue and the sort function, while the C# version uses the built-in `OrderBy` function. The Java version uses the `poll` method to remove the front of the priority queue, while the C# version uses an index to access the elements of the arrays.
